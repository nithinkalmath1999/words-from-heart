        <h1>What is Online Menu</h1>
        <hr class="mt-0 bg-dark"/>
        <p class="fs-5">Online Menu is a digital platform offered by Shreeshantha IT Solutions for food businesses: to enable contactless dining for dine-in customers, to take online orders for takeaway and home delivery
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">Online Menu focuses on Contactless and Paper-free objectives. During these post-pandemic times, itâ€™s important to recover business from the losses, but that should be done with a lot of safety measures.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">Online Menu is a B2B platform that provides opportunities to food businesses including restaurants, hotels, lodges, Dhabas, etc to host their offerings on the cloud. This platform enables these businesses to accept orders online within their premises and get exposure online to reach a higher audience and skyrocket their business.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">The digital environment of contact-less dining technology is just a bonus to the overall value proposition for customers.
        </p>
        <ul class="fs-5">
            <li>There are several options businesses have made available to their customers, whether it be on the website, via a first or third party app, SMS, or through QR code technology
            </li>
            <li>The benefits of contact-less ordering are numerous. It provides a safe, enhanced guest experience, streamlines operations, and increases throughput
            </li>
            <li>Contactless payments began growing in popularity before the pandemic, but since then they have increased across the board
            </li>

        <h1>Why Online Menu?</h1>
        <hr class="mt-0 bg-dark"/>
        <p class="fs-5">Most of the restaurants spend a lot of money on designing and printing the menu. Is that required in this digital era?
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">If your restaurant has 10 tables, each table needs one menu book. Suppose one menu book consists of 10 pages, then 100 pages should be designed and printed. What is the cost of printing and designing? And this is not a one-time investment, the menu needs to be updated periodically and now calculate the cost invested per annum and papers used to print..?
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">Great then! Now no need to calculate these costs anymore, Online Menu allows you to create your own personalized online menu, you can easily add, delete or update your items within minutes. Customers can access your Online Menu from their phones and place their orders and can enjoy contactless dining. Your customers need to scan the provided QR code or visit the menu URL to place orders online. After the orders, the automated bill is generated for both owners and customers.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5"><strong>Simple</strong>: Online Menu is simple to use. No App download is needed, customers should scan the QR code or visit the URL and access the restaurant menu. Customers no need to wait until the waiter gets the menu book.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5"><strong>Contactless</strong> Hospitality technology which overcomes covid-19 period related challenges, we are expanding the executive bench to capitalise on that opportunity. Together, we modernize the restaurant dining room with our tool. (TVT- Touch Vision n Taste)- MAKE THE FUTURE SAFE.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5"><strong>Paper-free</strong>: Online Menu is an Eco-friendly platform that saves a lot of paper and indirectly saves trees from cutting down.
        </p>
        <ul class="fs-5">
            <li>Menu book pages are saved</li>
            <li>Billing papers were also saved</li>
        </ul>
