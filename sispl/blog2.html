        <h1>How to use Online Menu?</h1>
        <hr class="mt-0 bg-dark"/>
        <p class="fs-5">Before going through the user guide of Online Menu, make sure you know “What is Online Menu?”. Click to read the article.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">As our tagline says “SIMPLE” because it’s very simple to use for both customers and consumers (here customers refers to Businesses or vendors and consumers refers to end users or end customers). The most unique feature of this platform is “NO DOWNLOAD”, you need not download any kind of application or software to use our service and this is a completely web based system.  This user guide can be best explained in two parts.
        <ul>
            <li class="fs-5">Customers</li>
            <li class="fs-5">Consumers</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <ol class="fs-5">
            <li class="fs-4"><strong>Customers – Business owners and Vendors.</strong></li>
            <p class="fs-5">Who are the customers? - Any businesses who like to reach a large number of audience in their locality and increase their sales (service or product) are the customers. <br>
            Example: Restaurants, grocery shops, salons etc. to be short almost all kinds of businesses.
                </p>
            <h5>Here are the steps to use.</h5>
            <h5><strong>Step 1</strong>-Register and Get Started.</h5>
            <p class="fs-5">Sign up for free using the Get Started button, or click here to Get Started using a few simple steps.
                Enter all the details asked and submit. Get a one month demo setup for your business.
                </p>
            <h5><strong>Step 2</strong>-Create your Menu.</h5>
            <p class="fs-5">After creating your account, you can create your own menu in a few minutes; we already have the list of items for your business particularly. You just need to tap and select the items and set your price for the product or service you're providing. Once you're done with creating your Online Menu generate QR code of your Menu and place it in your shop. Ask your consumers to scan the QR code and order the items, they can also order from their home by revisiting your menu through the same website. You can now only concentrate on sales rather than explaining to your consumers about your product or services every time.</p>
            <h5><strong>Step 3</strong>-Receive orders.</h5>
            <p class="fs-5">Once your consumers scan QR code and place orders then you get them in your dashboard. There you can accept the orders and deliver them. As a business person there is no need to remember all the items ordered by the consumer, and it’s difficult to remember all the items if 4+ people order at a time, it's a mess right! So this system saves the orders for you and you can refer before you print the bill. This creates a perfect database for your business and helps you to understand the interests of your consumers.
            </p>
            <li class="fs-4"><strong>Consumers- End users or End customers.</strong></li>
            <p class="fs-5">Who are consumers? – All your customers, everyone who buys your services or products are the consumers.
            </p>
            <h5>Here are the steps to use.</h5>
            <h5><strong>Step 1</strong>-Scan QR code or visit the URL.</h5>
            <p class="fs-5">When you are in a store or restaurant which has Online Menu service, you need to scan the QR code provided by the vendor. You can scan through the scanner which you already have in your mobile. Or you can visit the URL provided just below the bar code. After scanning it redirects to the browser and then to the Menu of the store.
            </p>
            <h5><strong>Step 2</strong>-Place order.</h5>
            <p class="fs-5">Once the menu is up in your browser you will be able to see all the items that are available in that particular store along with the price of the items. Select the items of your choice and place order and takeaway. And if you want to order again anything from the same store, then you can revisit the URL and order the items, the order will be delivered to your doorstep.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5">
